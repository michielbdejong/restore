# this fork of [gh:jcoglan/restore](https://github.com/jcoglan/restore) was merged into [gh:michielbdejong/resite](https://github.com/michielbdejong/resite).

Don't use this. If you want just a remoteStorage server, you can use @jcoglan's reStore. If you want to run an IndieWeb site controlled through a remoteStorage API, use reSite, into which this repo was merged.

Thanks!
